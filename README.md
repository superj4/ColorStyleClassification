# ColorStyleClassification
Classify images based on color style

Stage 1: Feature Extraction with Java
Read images pixel by pixel
For each image, cluster colors using K-means to extract k major colors
Map color weights to 64 color ranges in color space
Calculate grayscale and contrast 

Stage 2: Machine Learning with R
Manual classification from human perspective
75% training data, 25% test data
Use learning models: Random Forest, SVM, Generalized Boosted Regression

Stage 3: Data Visualization
Display images in categories in webpage
